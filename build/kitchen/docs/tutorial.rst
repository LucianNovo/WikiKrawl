Using kitchen to write good code
================================

Kitchen's functions won't automatically make you a better programmer.  You
have to learn when and how to use them as well.  This section of the
documentation is intended to show you some of the ways that you can apply
kitchen's functions to problems that may have arisen in your life.  The goal
of this section is to give you enough information to understand what the
kitchen API can do for you and where in the :ref:`KitchenAPI` docs to look
for something that can help you with your next issue.  Along the way,
you might pick up the knack for identifying issues with your code before you
publish it.  And that *will* make you a better coder.
